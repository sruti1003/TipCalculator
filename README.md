# SHTipCalculator
This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS.

This application is just a way to showcase custom UI Components in iOS. It used Swift and AutoLayout. For Animations, it uses UIKit Dynamics. There's a custom controller that interpolates the background color between different colors.
